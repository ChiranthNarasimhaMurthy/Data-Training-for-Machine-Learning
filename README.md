# Project Information

This project was developed using the concept of Machine Learning and the programming language Python 3. Machine learning is the study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to perform a specific task without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead. The main focus of this project is to monitor how increasing the amount of data training for a machine learning algorithm can recognize handwritten digits that increases the accuracy of the algorithm.
